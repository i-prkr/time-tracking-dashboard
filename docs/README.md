## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to learn and use CSS attributes, having not used them much before. It was fun to implement the page filtering through the use of CSS, and I can see some benefits in this without having to remove and add elements to the DOM when interacting during runtime.

### Continued development

I am eager to continue becoming deeply familiar with these more advanced CSS techniques, and learning better how to integrate them into projects. I also felt I was better at spending time planning out the solution this time before building, and want to keep working on this.
