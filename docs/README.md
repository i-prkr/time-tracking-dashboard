- [Triangle in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/) - This helped me to create a CSS triangle for the bottom of the share bar when viewed on larger screens.
- [MDN SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Getting_Started) - This helped with understanding SVG files and how to manipulate them for correct sizing and placement.
